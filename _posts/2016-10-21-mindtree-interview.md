## My MindTree Interview Experience on 20th Oct 2016

### **Written test at SRIT:**

We had a online Aptitude test at our College(SRIT, Anantapur) in which 25 questions from Quantitative Aptitude, 25 from English and 25 from Reasoning were given. Once we cleared this round, we had a Coding round consisting of 2 questions which was pretty easy. Some of the questions given to us are as follows:

**Questions given in coding round:**
- given two arrays, merge them and sort them
- Pattern programs
- Rotate an array , clockwise or anticlockwise
- Sort an array by frequency of the elements
- gcd of array of numbers
- Linked list , Circular linked list
- String comparision
- substring search
- check whether a given string is a rotated form of another given string
- Dynamic memory allocation (they were specifically mentioning to do using DMA only)
- etc.,

Then the shortlisted people were called to Gudlavalleru Engineering College, Gudivada.

We had Technical Round and HR Round there.

### **Technical Round:**

Technical Round was pretty diverse depending on the interviewer, some were asked very easy questions.I had my resume filled up with a bunch of technologies I tinkered with during my 4 years.

In my TR, I was asked various questions regarding SQL, I am particularly strong at Programming but wasn't asked any algorithmic questions. All the questions were on SQL such as UNION vs UNION ALL, write some queries given the schema, RANK vs DENSE RANK, How do you get the current date in MySQL, JOINs, CHAR vs VARCHAR  etc., were asked. I wish I had been asked some Algorithmic Questions.. :)

### **HR Round:**

So I passed TR and was sent to HR , where I was asked about myself, my hobbies and whether I read any books, how I learnt Python , what my most unforgettable moment is and whether I'm relocatable.

Then After a few hours of waiting , the results were announced and I had the first page of offer letter in my hand.

Overall there were 57 students who were shortlisted from written tests out of which 17 were given the offer letter (we had 24 people from our college and 8 people got through)
